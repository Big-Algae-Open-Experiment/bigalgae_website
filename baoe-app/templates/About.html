                    <p align='center'>Algae are amazing: they recycle over half of the carbon
                        dioxide we breathe out and are important for many food
                        chains. However, we still understand very little about
                        how they grow. In future, we may wish to grow algae for
                        food, fuel, or to clean up wastewater so we need to
                        understand more about their biology!</p>

             <p>With the above message in mind, we have set up
                the Big Algae Open Experiment to help us extend our knowledge
                of algae by performing the biggest parallel algae experiment in
                history! We are inviting Universities and citizen scientists to
                participate in an open-source data collection experiment on
                outdoor microalgal growth. Up and down the UK, we'll be running
                experiments using a bioreactor we have designed and asking
                people to submit their recordings of how well the algae are
                growing. Following and recording the algal growth will be easy
                for everyone to do, even if they have no previous scientific
                experience, thanks to this website!</p>
                
            <p>The Big Algae Open Experiment operates based on
                three steps:</p>
            <h3 class='green-underline'><span>1) Create an open-source photobioreactor</span></h3>
            <p>The photobioreactor we will use to grow the algae
                is designed to be inexpensive, easy to build and simple to use.
                The current prototype is an airlift-type reactor built from
                readily available materials, using an aquarium pump for sparging
                of air. Parts for the reactor were produced using a laser-cutter,
                a widely-available 'maker' tool. There will be instructions for
                an Arduino based monitoring system if you'd like to collect data
                about light and temperature too. We will be publishing the
                instructions here on the website for you to follow.</p>
            <h3 class='green-underline'><span>2) Create a web based application for the Big Algae Open Experiment</span></h3>
            <p>While some people have access to a lab, many more
                people have access to a smartphone. We wanted to create a way to
                use the camera on your phone to collect data on algal growth,
                so we've made an web based app to enable many more of you to get
                involved! At Big Algae HQ, we've been testing our app with
                laboratory growth data to produce standard curves. This is a
                fancy way of saying that by snapping a picture using the app,
                we can translate the image into data on how well the algae are
                growing.</p>
            <h3 class='green-underline'><span>3) Organise the Big Algae Open Experiment</span></h3>
            <p>The Big Algae Open Experiment will operate as a
                hub-and-spoke model; we will ask Universities to sign up
                for the project and recruit partner schools or community groups.
                Everybody will run the same experiment. We would like you to visit
                each other and work together to learn more about algae. This will also
                enable the researchers at Universities to show people around
                their lab, and explain more about their jobs. It may even
                inspire some of you to think about a career in science! Throughout
                the month, growth data will be uploaded to our app and at the
                end of the month will be analysed. During the month you'll be
                able to compare how well your bioreactor is performing compared
                to other schools and Universities. At the end of the month, we
                will be able to look for correlations between environmental
                conditions and biomass growth. Once the Big Algae Open Experiment
                has finished, the dataset will be made publicly available for other
                researchers to benefit from.</p>
