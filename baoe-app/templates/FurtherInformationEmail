Thank you for validating bioreactor {{ reactor_id }}!.

You can now begin experimenting!

Before you can do so, you'll need to register a new experiment.

Your experiment validation code is {{ experiment_validation_code }}.
Keep this code secret, as otherwise anyone will be able to create new experiments for your bioreactor.

Your upload code is {{ upload_code }}.
This code must be displayed near your bioreactor. When someone takes a photo of the calibration slip, they must enter this code to upload the photo.
This code is to stop people navigating to your experiment pages and uploading photos which may disrupt your results.

If you have any questions, please contact us!

Many thanks,

The Big Algae Open Experiment Team
