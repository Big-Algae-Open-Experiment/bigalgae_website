                <p align='justify'>Brenda has worked on applied phycology for
                    the past 5 years, primarily on downstream processing of
                    algae and bioremediation. Along with designers at Wayward
                    Plants, she created the <a href='http://www.wayward.co.uk/work/garden/algaegarden'>Algaegarden</a>,
                    an exhibit selected for the Metis International Festival in
                    Quebec. Brenda was supported by a Public Engagement Award from the SGM for her
                    algae installations for Secret Cinema and FARM:shop in London.
                    She currently holds a Churchill fellowship on bioremediation.</p>

                <hr>
                <p align='justify'>Paolo has a multidisciplinary background with
                    specific interests in energy conversion, photosynthesis and
                    electrochemistry. Since 2007 he has been pioneering the
                    development of algal solar panels known as Bio Photo Voltaic
                    systems, featured in national and international press.
                    He is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of
                    Biochemistry at Cambridge with the title of "algal electrician".</p>

                <p align='justify'>James is a Teaching Fellow in Biochemical
                    Engineering and his research focuses on the design and
                    fabrication of small-scale tools for bioprocesFs
                    development. James works extensively with UCL's Institute of
                    Making, where he has developed expertise on a range of
                    'making' tools, including 3D printers and laser cutters. He
                    is currently part of Lego2Nano, an international project with
                    the aim of redesigning scientific tools (such as atomic
                    force microscopes) to reduce their cost and make them
                    accessible for schools and citizen scientists.</p>

                <a href='mailto:marc.jones@jic.ac.uk'>marc.jones@jic.ac.uk</a>
                <hr>
                <p align='justify'>Marc is a PhD student in the group
                    of Prof. Richard Morris, working on the control of
                    flowering in the crop plant <em>Brassica napus</em>. The
                    project applies experimental and computational approaches
                    to transfer knowledge from <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> to
                    a more economically important plant species.
                    Previously, Marc studied Systems Biology at the University
                    of Cambridge, during which time he was exposed to a wide
                    range of computational techniques and their application to
                    biological problems.</p>
